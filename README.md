:telescope: Iâ€™m currently a python software engineer working at NCAR on the Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit (GeoCAT) team. My primary project is the [GeoCAT-comp repository](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-comp) where I create new geoscience speficic computational functions for Earth scientists to use in their workflows.

:sauropod: In the past, I've worked extensively on the [GeoCAT Example Gallery](https://geocat-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which has a large variety of scientific data visualizations specifically for the Earth sciences. 

:seedling: Iâ€™m currently learning how to apply for grad school!
